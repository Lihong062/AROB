# Optional script to run each time the module is loaded,
# AFTER it is started.
#
# Commands in this file should be exactly as you would type
# interactively into the JeVois command-line interface.
#
# Example:
#
# setcam brightness 1
# setpar cpumax 1200
# info

# Set camera to fixed color balance, gain, and exposure, so that we get more reliable colors than we would obtain under
# automatic mode:
setcam autowb 0
setcam autogain 0
setcam autoexp 0
setcam redbal 110
setcam bluebal 170
setcam gain 16
setcam absexp 500
setcam presetwb 3
